# Int-analysis
Intermediate analysis is the second course on analysis for quantitative economics and data science as a second semester mathematics course. The course is three folds: 

In the first fold, we discuss sequence & series of functions and Weierstrauss approximation theorem with Power serires & Fourier series, then we discuss Riemann integration.

In the second fold , we discuss calculus of several variables. In last fold, we discuss vector calculus.

Lecture-02 (10-01-2025): Convergency in sequence of functions.

Here, we consider a sequence of real valued functions defined over a common domain D as $(f_n)$. And we try to understand limiting behaviour of the sequence of functions as n is approaching to infinity.

There are two types of convergence:

1. Pointwise convergence: Pointwise dependency means for a given epsilon there is a natural number k depends on epsilon and the point x. There are various limitations of this convergence with limit at a point, continuing of the limit function, interchangibility with differentiability and integrability

2. Uniform convergence: Uniform convergence is having global nature that for given epsilon there a natural number k depends on epsilon only (i.e. k works for every x from the domain).
